                    <h3>The Extremly Transparent!!</h3><br>
                    As the pandemic hit us, our reality has taken a drastic change. The world has moved a pace forward
                    towards using more technology. At this point, the approach of action has turned from physical to
                    digital. Now meetings are no more preferred on physical
                    presence, but a laptop with a good internet connection will do the task. Social consumption has also
                    increased immensely. The necessity of being indoor has caused a rise in the average screen time of
                    humans hence increasing the requirement
                    of more content, which has led the content creators to become more transparent about their lives to
                    keep
                    up with the increasing demand for spicy content.The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth
                    or
                    nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles
                    range
                    from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
                    You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by
                    touching a
                    contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in
                    crowded settings.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
                    virus.
                    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover
                    without
                    special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.You can be
                    infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19.<br><br>
