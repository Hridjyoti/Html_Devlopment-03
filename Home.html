                            Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common
                            cold to more severe diseases. Find out more about this novel coronavirus (nCoV) that has not
                            been previously identified in humans. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
                            is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who fall sick with
                            COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
                            However, some will become seriously ill and require
                            medical attention.

                        The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they
                        cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
                        smaller aerosols. You can be infected by breathing in the
                        virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then
                        your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.

                    <li>
                        The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend
                        to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel
                        farther than 1 metre (long-range)
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact
                        with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols
                        or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly
                        into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus
                        when touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands
                    </li><br>
